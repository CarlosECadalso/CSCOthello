Notes:

- Each button has a delay factor calculation which allows for a token flip to occur in some order out from 
the position of the performed move. This means that if we have tokens x o o o and a user clicks the far right 
token to flip to x x x x the buttons get flipped in the following order x 3 2 1. The purpose of this is to 
show the board actually animating and changing. Note however the calculation is performed "as the crow flys". 
That means that if a user clicks (4,4) and the tokens at (4,3) and (3,4) flip, since they are one position 
away from the clicked button they get updated at the same time. This is intentional since we perform a 
breadth first search like calculation for determining the delay factor.

Notes:

- One of our team members had the music causing the program not to launch and through a difference
of Operating systems and non-native environments called InvocationTargetException in the 
java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method).
This was not a bug from our side and we are warning that a difference of operating systems in using the music effect
may cause the application not to launch.

- The music we used was from:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZlDn4EmTvo 
which has no copyright issues.

- The image gif used also had no copyright issues.

Team MarvelStudios (General Note):

- We all have agreed on the user stories and bugs that we have worked on from the very start of each sprint.
We have also assessed and kept track on the number of extra bugs and/or user stories that we filed 
and have agreed that we are all fairly happy on the number of bugs and/or user stories we filed.
We are writing this to inform you, the grader, to kindly assess us fairly and not to grade one person
committing more than the other on this assignment. We all understand who did what and never had any arguments 
or felt a sense of unfairness in terms of the commitment to the assignment.
Thank you


3e00a535eea7d32d235eab741b616f7eae87bb44 has been guaranteed to run on the lab computers - we made some 
changes to the txt files afterwards and are concerned that perhaps some config changes may have crept in.
